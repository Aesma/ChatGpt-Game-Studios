# Setup Engine — Required workflow continuation

This file contains required phases of `$setup-engine`. Read it in full when the main `SKILL.md` reaches its Required continuation section, then execute the phases in order.

## 7. Populate Engine Reference Docs

### If WITHIN training data (LOW RISK):

Create a minimal `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`:

```markdown
# [Engine] — Version Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Engine Version** | [version] |
| **Project Pinned** | [today's date] |
| **LLM Knowledge Cutoff** | May 2025 |
| **Risk Level** | LOW — version is within LLM training data |

## Note

This engine version is within the LLM's training data. Engine reference
docs are optional but can be added later if agents suggest incorrect APIs.

Run `$setup-engine refresh` to populate full reference docs at any time.
```

Do NOT create breaking-changes.md, deprecated-apis.md, etc. — they would
add context cost with minimal value.

### If BEYOND training data (MEDIUM or HIGH RISK):

Create the full reference doc set by searching the web:

1. **Search for the official migration/upgrade guide**:
   - `"[engine] [old version] to [new version] migration guide"`
   - `"[engine] [version] breaking changes"`
   - `"[engine] [version] changelog"`
   - `"[engine] [version] deprecated API"`

2. **Fetch and extract** from official documentation:
   - Breaking changes between each version from the training cutoff to current
   - Deprecated APIs with replacements
   - New features and best practices

Add this proposed file or edit to the complete changeset preview; do not write it until that changeset is authorized.

After the one changeset authorization, create all listed files without requesting another confirmation.

3. **Create the full reference directory**:
   ```
   docs/engine-reference/<engine>/
   ├── VERSION.md              # Version pin + knowledge gap analysis
   ├── breaking-changes.md     # Version-by-version breaking changes
   ├── deprecated-apis.md      # "Don't use X → Use Y" tables
   ├── current-best-practices.md  # New practices since training cutoff
   └── modules/                # Per-subsystem references (create as needed)
   ```

4. **Populate each file** using real data from the web searches, following
   the format established in existing reference docs. Every file must have
   a "Last verified: [date]" header.

5. **For module files**: Only create modules for subsystems where significant
   changes occurred. Don't create empty or minimal module files.

---

## 8. Update AGENTS.md Import

Add this proposed file or edit to the complete changeset preview; do not write it until that changeset is authorized.

Once the complete changeset is authorized, update the `@` import under "Engine Version Reference" to point to the
correct engine:

```markdown
## Engine Version Reference

@docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md
```

If the previous import pointed to a different engine (e.g., switching from
Godot to Unity), update it.

---

## 9. Update Agent Instructions

Add the agent-instruction edits to the complete changeset preview and do not write them until that changeset is authorized.

For the chosen engine's specialist agents, verify they have a
"Version Awareness" section. If not, add one following the pattern in
the existing Godot specialist agents.

The section should instruct the agent to:
1. Read `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`
2. Check deprecated APIs before suggesting code
3. Check breaking changes for relevant version transitions
4. Use web search to verify uncertain APIs

---

## 10. Refresh Subcommand

If invoked as `$setup-engine refresh`:

1. Read the existing `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md` to get
   the current engine and version
2. Use web search to check for:
   - New engine releases since last verification
   - Updated migration guides
   - Newly deprecated APIs
3. Update all reference docs with new findings
4. Update "Last verified" dates on all modified files
5. Report what changed

---

## 11. Upgrade Subcommand

If invoked as `$setup-engine upgrade [old-version] [new-version]`:

### Step 1 — Read Current Version State

Read `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md` to confirm the current pinned
version, risk level, and any migration note URLs already recorded. If
`old-version` was not provided as an argument, use the pinned version from this
file.

### Step 2 — Fetch Migration Guide

Use web search and open the relevant web page to locate the official migration guide between
`old-version` and `new-version`:

- Search: `"[engine] [old-version] to [new-version] migration guide"`
- Search: `"[engine] [new-version] breaking changes changelog"`
- Fetch the migration guide URL from VERSION.md if one is already recorded,
  or use the URL found via search.

Extract: renamed APIs, removed APIs, changed defaults, behavior changes, and
any "must migrate" items.

### Step 3 — Pre-Upgrade Audit

Scan `src/` for code that uses APIs known to be deprecated or changed in the
target version:

- Search to search for deprecated API names extracted from the migration
  guide (e.g., old function names, removed node types, changed property names)
- List each file that matches, with the specific API reference found

Present the audit results as a table:

```
Pre-Upgrade Audit: [engine] [old-version] → [new-version]
==========================================================

Files requiring changes:
  File                              | Deprecated API Found       | Effort
  --------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------
  src/gameplay/player_movement.gd   | old_api_name               | Low
  src/ui/hud.gd                     | removed_node_type          | Medium

Breaking changes to watch for:
  - [change description from migration guide]
  - [change description from migration guide]

Recommended migration order (dependency-sorted):
  1. [system/layer with fewest dependencies first]
  2. [next system]
  ...
```

If no deprecated APIs are found in `src/`, report: "No deprecated API usage
found in src/ — upgrade may be low-risk."

### Step 4 — Confirm Upgrade Scope

Ask the user whether the upgrade should be included in the proposed changeset:

> "Pre-upgrade audit complete. Found [N] files using deprecated APIs.
> Proceed with upgrading VERSION.md to [new-version]?
> (This will update the pinned version and add migration notes — it does NOT
> change any source files. Source migration is done manually or via stories.)"

Treat the answer as a scope decision, then present the complete changeset for its one authorization.

### Step 5 — Update VERSION.md

Once the complete changeset is authorized:

1. Update `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`:
   - `Engine Version` → `[new-version]`
   - `Project Pinned` → today's date
   - `Last Docs Verified` → today's date
   - Re-evaluate and update the `Risk Level` and `Post-Cutoff Version Timeline`
     table if the new version falls beyond the LLM knowledge cutoff
   - Add a `## Migration Notes — [old-version] → [new-version]` section
     containing: migration guide URL, key breaking changes, deprecated APIs
     found in this project, and recommended migration order from the audit

2. If `breaking-changes.md` or `deprecated-apis.md` exist in the engine
   reference directory, append the new version's changes to those files.

### Step 6 — Post-Upgrade Reminder

After updating VERSION.md, output:

```
VERSION.md updated: [engine] [old-version] → [new-version]

Next steps:
1. Migrate deprecated API usages in the [N] files listed above
2. Run $setup-engine refresh after upgrading the actual engine binary to
   verify no new deprecations were missed
3. Run $architecture-review — the engine upgrade may invalidate ADRs that
   reference specific APIs or engine capabilities
4. If any ADRs are invalidated, run $propagate-design-change to update
   downstream stories
```

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — engine configured and reference docs populated.

## Guardrails

- NEVER guess an engine version — always verify via web search or user confirmation
- NEVER overwrite existing reference docs silently — preview whether each file is appended, updated, or replaced
- If reference docs already exist for a different engine, surface the replacement in the complete changeset preview
- Always show the user what you're about to change before making AGENTS.md edits
- If web search returns ambiguous results, show the user and let them decide
- When the user chose **GDScript**: copy the GDScript AGENTS.md template from Appendix A1 exactly. NEVER add "C++ via GDExtension" to the Language field. GDScript projects may use GDExtension, but it is not a primary project language. The `godot-gdextension-specialist` in the routing table is available for when native extensions are needed — it does not make C++ a project language.

---

## Appendix A — Godot Language Configuration

All Godot-specific variants for language-dependent configuration. Referenced from Sections 4 and 5 — only relevant when Godot is the chosen engine. Use the subsection matching the language chosen in Section 4.

---

### A1. AGENTS.md Technology Stack Templates

**GDScript:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Godot [version]
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Build System**: SCons (engine), Godot Export Templates
- **Asset Pipeline**: Godot Import System + custom resource pipeline
```

> **Guardrail**: When using this GDScript template, write the Language field as exactly "`GDScript`" — no additions. Do NOT append "C++ via GDExtension" or any other language. The C# template below includes GDExtension because C# projects commonly wrap native code; GDScript projects do not.

**C#:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Godot [version]
- **Language**: C# (.NET 8+, primary), C++ via GDExtension (native plugins only)
- **Build System**: .NET SDK + Godot Export Templates
- **Asset Pipeline**: Godot Import System + custom resource pipeline
```

**Both — GDScript + C#:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Godot [version]
- **Language**: GDScript (gameplay/UI scripting), C# (performance-critical systems), C++ via GDExtension (native only)
- **Build System**: .NET SDK + Godot Export Templates
- **Asset Pipeline**: Godot Import System + custom resource pipeline
```

---

### A2. Naming Conventions

**GDScript:**
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerController`)
- Variables/functions: snake_case (e.g., `move_speed`)
- Signals: snake_case past tense (e.g., `health_changed`)
- Files: snake_case matching class (e.g., `player_controller.gd`)
- Scenes: PascalCase matching root node (e.g., `PlayerController.tscn`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)

**C#:**
- Classes: PascalCase (`PlayerController`) — must also be `partial`
- Public properties/fields: PascalCase (`MoveSpeed`, `JumpVelocity`)
- Private fields: `_camelCase` (`_currentHealth`, `_isGrounded`)
- Methods: PascalCase (`TakeDamage()`, `GetCurrentHealth()`)
- Signal delegates: PascalCase + `EventHandler` suffix (`HealthChangedEventHandler`)
- Files: PascalCase matching class (`PlayerController.cs`)
- Scenes: PascalCase matching root node (`PlayerController.tscn`)
- Constants: PascalCase (`MaxHealth`, `DefaultMoveSpeed`)

**Both — GDScript + C#:**
Use GDScript conventions for `.gd` files and C# conventions for `.cs` files. Mixed-language files do not exist — the boundary is per-file. When in doubt about which language a new system should use, ask the user and record the decision in `technical-preferences.md`.
